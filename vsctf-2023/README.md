# ViewSource CTF 2023

## Overview

This was an exciting CTF that was of Medium-Hard difficulty that ran from 0900 UTC-7 SEPT 23 2023 to 0900 UTC-7 SEPT 24 2023.

## Review

Most of the challenges were awesome. Some of the challenges were extremely difficult and out of my skillset, but hopefully I can come back to them with some released write-ups and learn a thing or two. 

I focused on doing Forensics for this CTF where I investigated malicious actors across local files in a ROBLOX game and reading Riot Game's VANGUARD anti-cheat logs to find flags.
